# About
Qiyue Kang is research engineer at Xihu Xinchen company at Hangzhou, China. His current research interests include how to train a large langeuage model (LLM), using supervised finetuning(SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (PPO). In addition, he also focuses on evaluating LLM, and accelerating the LLM inference. The main goal is to build a better Chinese LLM.


Before that, Qiyue Kang is a postdoctoral fellow at the Deep Learning Lab (DLL, [homepage](https://dll-wu.github.io/)), Westlake University, Hangzhou, China. His supervisor is Prof. Zhenzhong Lan. After joining the DLL, he first developed a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to predict the small molecule retention time, which showed competitive capability compared to the models in the literature. In addition, he worked on the prediction of protein mutational effects using the pre-trained language model and graph neural network. Furthermore, he is working on some problems of Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involve multitask learning of NLP, and LLM SFT finetuning.

Qiyue Kang received his B.S. degree in chemistry from China Agricultural University in 2016. He received his Ph.D. degree in environmental geography from Peking University in 2021. His thesis was directed by Prof. Jianying Hu ([homepage](http://oause.pku.edu.cn/szdw/personal/hjy/)). The thesis is mainly about the nontarget analysis of Per- and polyÔ¨Çuoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and their health effects on female reproduction. PFASs are a large kind of environmental pollutes and widely used in multiple fields. His study developed a nontarget data-processing method, which merged diagnostic fragment ion and diagnostic neutral loss in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode for the data obtained from Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Using the developed method, the study identified lots of legacy and emerging PFASs. In addition, he conducted a large-scale environmental epidemiology study of PFASs, which revealed the potential health effects of PFAS on female reproduction.
